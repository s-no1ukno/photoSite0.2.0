# Lex's Photo WebApp
The second attempt at designing Alex a webapp portfolio for her photography. As soon as it gets along a little ways, a vote will be had to decide whether she likes the outline of this or the other one better.

## Outline
- Pages
  - Landing/Home
  - About
  - Contact
  - Portfolio
    - Portraits
    - Family
    - Weddings
    - Boudior (?? maybe)
    - Kiddos
  
## Front-end Design
- Static multipage app design
- Not necessarily mobile-first, but definitely beautifully responsive

## Back-end Design
- Do we need a back-end?
  - Internally save picture files, or store them in a database?
