          <p>Well, I have to write about me, and I'm not particularly good at this so I promise, eventually, there will
            be something useful about me by the end!</p>
          <br>
          <p>I have a wonderful husband (who has surprisingly put up with me thus far, on top of making this crazy
            website for me), and a step-son. I don't think I could get through life without them! I am blessed with a
            very big family, some blood and some bonded, and am grateful every day for the memories I am so lucky to be
            able to make.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I have fought very hard for this life I have, and am determined to really make something of myself!</p>
          <br>
          <p>I am a Colorado girl, currently working on my Animal Science Bachelor's Degree at CSU-Fort Collins, and
            quickly approaching Vet School. My unlitmate goals are to make it out as a doctor before I drown in student
            debt, and to grow this company before it is time to open my own practice!</p>
